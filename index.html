            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am the firstborn in a family of five, which includes my parents and two younger siblings. This position has instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility and the importance of being a positive role model for my brother and sister.

            <p>My educational journey began at KCO Group of Schools for my primary education, followed by Orero Boys High School for my secondary education.</p>
            <h3>Why Community Health?</h3>
            <p>My decision to pursue Community Health stems from a deep-seated desire to make a tangible difference in people's lives at a foundational level. I am particularly interested in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding the social determinants of health and how they impact communities.</li>
                <li>Promoting health education and preventive measures to improve overall well-being.</li>

                <li>Addressing health disparities and promoting health equity within communities.</li>
                <li>My passion lies in empowering individuals and communities to take control of their health and create healthier environments.</li>

                </div>
                <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turkey pieces (e.g., drumsticks, thighs, wings)</li>
                    <li>All-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Black pepper</li>
                    <li>Garlic powder</li>
                    <li>Paprika</li>
                    <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
                    <li>Optional: Other spices like cayenne pepper for heat</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Cooking Instructions:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash and pat dry the turkey pieces thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>In a shallow dish, combine the flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and any other desired spices.</li>
                    <li>Dredge each piece of turkey in the flour mixture, ensuring it is fully coated. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
                    <li>Heat a generous amount of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or pot over medium-high heat (approximately 325-350°F or 160-175°C). The oil should be deep enough to partially submerge the turkey.</li>
                    <li>Carefully place the coated turkey pieces into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry in batches if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Fry for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until the turkey is golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature of 165°F or 74°C).</li>
                    <li>Remove the fried turkey pieces from the oil and place them on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>

                </div>
                <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup white rice (long grain or your preference)</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups coconut milk</li>
                    <li>½ cup water (optional, adjust for desired consistency)</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
                    <li>Optional: A small piece of ginger, a pandan leaf (knotted) for added flavor</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Cooking Instructions:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rinse the white rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch.</li>
                    <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed rice, coconut milk, water (if using), and salt. If using, add the piece of ginger and/or knotted pandan leaf.</li>
                    <li>Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan tightly with a lid, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked through and fluffy. Avoid lifting the lid during this time.</li>
                    <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5-10 minutes to allow the steam to finish cooking the rice.</li>
                    <li>Fluff the rice with a fork before serving. Discard the ginger and pandan leaf if used.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot as a side dish to your favorite meals.</li>
                </ol>
